**Fix:** According to your `.clinerules/website-style-standards.md`, all pages should include:
```html
<img src="https://tvecnfdqakrevzaeifpk.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/caseworks/FINAL_JUSTICE_GUARDIAN_FOORTER.svg" alt="Footer" style="width: 100%; display: block;">
```

### Issue 2: Missing Header Hero Image (3 pages)
- index.html
- cultural-exploitation-indian-workers.html

**article-hilton-investigation.html** and **the-one-person-principle.html** are missing:
