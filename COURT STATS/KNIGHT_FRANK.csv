Unfortunately, I am not available to reply immediately as it's already emotional, and I have",NO REPLY OPENED 11 times ,"Dear Knight Frank, I am writing to inform you that my father's funeral is
scheduled for tomorrow.

Unfortunately, I am not available to reply immediately
as it's already emotional, and I have other various matters I am forced to deal
with.

I want to address concerns beyond the issues with Knight Frank and the
lofty silences.

I would like again to attempt to initiate a dialogue regarding a
child whose needs may potentially not be met due to a web of ineffective actions
of certain adults.

I strongly believe in ensuring that children receive the care
they require, and I am deeply concerned about their well-being.

While my own
needs are not being upheld or met based on reasons known to be skewed with
complexities and disability, I cannot stand idly by while Anton and Bees child
does not receive the necessary support.

I still feel unsafe, gripping tightly to every penny, there is no relief, only
more anxiety and stress to obtain equitable treatment and communication.

To
which there has been none , no invitation, or any effort to understand how
others around and unto myself have seriously impacted my day to day, my work and
opportunities, and most regrettably- potentially another child.

It is crucial to recognize that the issue lies in the adults' around--inability
to cooperate, rather than the child themselves and they must not be affected
directly.

Therefore, it is essential to identify and address the specific needs
of the child.

I am prepared to make sacrifices to ensure that the child's needs
are met.

In addition to the current situations and missed steps causing havoc,
along with my father's funeral to attend and various financial obligations to
fulfill.

However, I firmly believe that the child's needs must take precedence.

To facilitate communication and documentation, I kindly request that we begin a
dialogue of our discussion amicably so more innocent people do not get hurt.

The
statutory dissonance should not in a way be directed towards children.

Please contact Richard, who can then reach out to me to initiate a healthier
process about real pertinent matters of those who sadly have no choice or voice-
yet, which is the younger lives we are, and all should be taking responsibility
from whether they are our own children or not, they have no choice, you do, make
effective ones.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I am committed to
finding a resolution that prioritizes the child's well-being before these
differences and ensures their needs are met.

Addressing Serious Allegations and The Importance of Open Communication
* I received your email but feel there is a misunderstanding, which I hope you
will share a moment for me to redefine and hopefully clear up.

* Firstly, I apologise as it seems you will have gotten an unnecessary stark
particle of the full picture- 'the top end of the letter'.

This coincides
with multiple factors of this entire situation and hope we will bring to a
better resolution.

* The infiltrating particle of the email to any eye - has no portrayal of
pleasantries, which sadly is a false enactment of the full picture I was
offering, and that shares the opposite of its assumed agenda that is less
favoured by us both.

My full message contains my hope to get the situation
in better, more equitable shape, for all most importantly for Abel, second
Emily, and third Ashley.

Ms. Dobson, I hope you can appreciate that there is
much at stake in this set-up whereby Abels needs are ultimately met.

* Not my nephew, but a child all the same.

No-one has lost more through this
than me and Abel, I can assure you.

To which, without doubt, is all uncalled
for everyone involved.

It needs to be put right, smoothly ,without hassle,
in the most effective and less disparaging way, mostly for Abel along with
accompanying parties.

It's important you know, despite any unfounded
pre-perceptions of me that I detest, I am doing my best to keep our
partners and Abels family out of havoc.

Albeit, our previous encounters have
not been ideal, but it certainly has not without its benefits.

1.

The Gravity of the Matter:
The nature of your allegations is very serious, and it is crucial to approach
this matter with the severity it deserves.

I would like to reiterate that my
repeated attempts to communicate are not indicative of obsession, malintent, or
defiance, but rather a manifestation of my Autism-induced hyper-focus.

This
hyper-focus is not a detriment, but a testament to my commitment to caring for
people, seeking justice, and ensuring that policies are correctly implemented.

Contrary to what might be perceived, my actions are driven by a desire to
protect not just my nephew, but also the service providers who, like yourself,
have put a lot of effort, time, and dedication into reaching their current
positions.

These positions are vital and should be protected from being
undermined by individuals who have not invested an equivalent amount of time or
effort into serving the public trust.

This is not to suggest that only those who
have heavily invested in their professional development are deserving of
protection.

Rather, it serves to emphasize the principles of fairness and
natural justice.

Currently, the imbalance in this regard has become
significantly out of scale, disproportionately favoring certain individuals and
completely devoid of prudence.

2.

The Danger of Closed Communication
* My condition is exacerbated by a lack of open communication.

As per the
Equality Act 2010 s 20, s21, public bodies are required to make reasonable
adjustments for individuals with disabilities, including facilitating
effective communication.

By not adhering to these requirements, the
authorities pose inadvertently to be contributing to a potentially
dangerous situation for individuals like myself and a violation of the law.

My reasonable request in the previous email politely asks for-such, to
acquit these damaging impacts, hence why I missed my fathers funeral, hyper
fixated in this response.

I question following your dismissal of me with
allegations not any reflection of my character, making really hurtful and
damaging allegations of fraud, criminal activity and refusal to talk with
me, what attempts to fairly meet this request have you made? Other than
dismiss my attempt for reasonable fair communication? Whereby I should be
carrying the coffin of my fathers.

I am sat here messaging you, desperate
for co-operation holding on to hope that I could protect you, Emily and the
other social workers because that is the right thing to do.

My father has
passed and I am now going to be in the firing line of a lot of hate for
missing it as my fathers youngest son.

I am still open to cooperate, please
don't make this another loss of valuable time, I don't get the chance to see
my father again please don't let this be a double loss- if not for me or
Abel.

3.

Respect for Your Profession and Dedication:
* I want to assure you that I hold a great deal of respect for your profession
and the time, care, and dedication you have invested to reach your current
position.

I understand that the work you do is complex and nuanced, and I
appreciate your efforts.

4.

Concern for the Welfare of Others:
* Unlike some individuals involved in this matter, who may not have dedicated
as much time and effort to understanding the impact of their actions, I am
deeply committed to preventing the unnecessary suffering of people and
families.

Those who have not given the same level of care and dedication
should not be the ones setting precedents in such serious matters.

5.

A Plea for Cooperation:
* In light of the above, I urge us to work together to address this situation.

With open and respectful communication, we can ensure that the principles of
justice, fairness, and equality are upheld.

* 7.

Regarding your claims
1.

Firstly,
You stated that the local authority will not communicate with me in any
matter regarding Ms. Ashley Macklin or her son.

This refusal appears to
disregard my request for reasonable adjustments under Section 20 and 21 of
the Equality Act 2010.

The Act requires organizations to make necessary
accommodations to ensure fair and equal communication with individuals with
disabilities, such as Autism.

The case of *Finnigan v Northumbria Police
(2013)* further underscores the duty of public bodies to make reasonable
adjustments in their communication.

2.

Secondly
Your suggestion to ""cease contacting the local authority and other
professional services"" seems to limit my right to freedom of expression.

As
an individual with Autism, I have a legal right to engage with public
bodies and access information, just like any other citizen.

This is
supported by the case of *Chambers v DPP (2012)*, which affirmed the
importance of freedom of expression, even in digital communications.

3.

Thirdly
Your warning against posting correspondence from the local authority on a
public domain raises questions about transparency and public trust?.

Especially in regards to family unlawful family separation, multiple
confessions from the mothers of many different accounts involving many.

different partners.

Whereby the police have apologised and dropped cases
against me due to malicious intent, worry for there being more evidence
respect for the same for our partners.

While I appreciate the need for confidentiality, my request for a read
signature on all emails is a reasonable adjustment section 20,21 to manage
the ambiguity and anxiety associated with my Autism.

This is not an attempt
to breach confidentiality but a necessary step to ensure equal
communication, as mandated by the Equality Act 2010.

In a similar vein, the
*Gurung v Ministry of Defence (2019)* case highlighted the importance of
transparency in communications.

As I am aware its not uncommon for the
rights of those with autism to misplaced and judgements misaligned which
draws back again to equitable fair treatment under legislation and duty of
professional practitioners within the public services sector,
4.

Finally,
Your assertion that I am ""not involved in this matter"" seems to dismiss my
legitimate interest in systemic issues of public interest.

As highlighted
in our 'Nature of Public Interest' document, our organization aims to
address these issues and stimulate impactful change.

My involvement is
guided by these principles, which are supported by the case of *R (on the
application of Guardian News and Media Ltd) v City of Westminster
Magistrates' Court (2012)*, which underscored the importance of public
interest in certain matters.

5.

In conclusion,
I would like to reiterate my commitment to ethical and legal practices,
including respect for individual rights and data protection laws.

I trust
this response provides a clear insight into our operating principles and
reaffirms our commitment to ethical and legal practice.

I hope that we can
continue to communicate in a manner that respects the principles of the
Equality Act 2010, particularly in light of the reasonable adjustments
required for my Autism
6.

Autism Hyper-focus and its Benefits and Risk.

Mine is triggered through being ignored and sends me into a spiral or
analysing and corroborating to find validation, security and
justification.

You will find many Autistics like myself will adopt or have special
interests which can become their only focus, some are on trains, the
function of appliances or reading instructions.

Mine is reading books, and
facts, it's not uncommon.

My forthrightness I remind you is not out of defiance but disability only
made worse by being ignored where I struggle to justify it.

I have missed
my Dads funeral.

His body I was meant to carry and lay to rest but we find
myself here justifying being ignored and now will have ruined my family's
day of placing my father to his last days.

You might clock off at the
weekend but I will live with this for the rest of my life, as will my
family.

7.

Justified in line with the statute and following legal case laws.

8.

Gurung v Ministry of Defence (2019): This case underscores the vital role
of transparency in communications.

It highlights how open dialogue is
essential in building cooperative understanding, especially in complex
situations.

This principle is directly relevant to ensuring that
individuals like Ben Mak can engage effectively with public authorities.

9.

10.

R (on the application of Guardian News and Media Ltd) v City of
Westminster Magistrates' Court (2012): This case accentuates the
significance of public interest in legal and administrative matters.

It
advocates for the involvement of the public and the availability of
accessible information, echoing the concerns raised by Mak in his quest for
clear and open communication.

11.

12.

Ellis v Bolton Council (2007): This landmark decision found that a
failure to constructively engage with an autistic complainant amounted to
disability discrimination under the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA)
1995.

It resonates deeply with the challenges faced by Mak, emphasizing the
need for public bodies to interact more thoughtfully with individuals with
disabilities.

13.

14.

J v DPP (2000): This case declared that unfettered prohibitions on
contacting authorities necessitate qualification respecting fairness
guarantees.

It reflects the concerns of individuals like Mak, who may face
barriers when trying to communicate with public authorities.

15.

16.

Equality Act 2010: This Act mandates reasonable adjustments to ensure
that autistic and disabled individuals can effectively access services and
information, just as others do.

This legislation is crucial in
understanding the adjustments requested by Mak in his communications.

17.

18.

Disability Discrimination Act 1995: As a forerunner in equality laws,
this Act imposes duties on public bodies to make dialogue and processes
inclusive for disabled people.

It sets a precedent that underscores the
rights and needs of individuals like Mak.

19.

20.

I collapsed and blacked out again with the stress and anguish of this
ongoing situation I am being silenced and dismissed on.

Which has been
happening for 2 nearly 3 years, 1 year to the very see and I have official
diagnosis of Autism see both attached doctors note and clinical diagnosis
from Chartered Psychologist.

1.

1.

I look forward to your understanding and cooperation.

Continued justification will happen

Many thanks
Ben.

* I tried to send this to Emily in June 2023 But Ashley wouldn't let me.

Her
allowance to dictate the circumstances of this situation is not only
damaging.

effective communication.

By not adhering to these requirements, the
authorities pose inadvertently to be contributing to a potentially
dangerous situation for individuals like myself and a violation of the law.

My reasonable request in the previous email politely asks for-such, to
acquit these damaging impacts, hence why I missed my fathers funeral, hyper
fixated in this response.

I question following your dismissal of me with
allegations not any reflection of my character, making really hurtful and
damaging allegations of fraud, criminal activity and refusal to talk with
me, what attempts to fairly meet this request have you made? Other than
dismiss my attempt for reasonable fair communication? Whereby I should be
carrying the coffin of my fathers.

I am sat here messaging you, desperate
for co-operation holding on to hope that I could protect you, Emily and the
other social workers because that is the right thing to do.

My father has
passed and I am now going to be in the firing line of a lot of hate for
missing it as my fathers youngest son.

I am still open to cooperate, please
don't make this another loss of valuable time, I don't get the chance to see
my father again please don't let this be a double loss- if not for me or
Abel.

Respect for Your Profession and Dedication:
* I want to assure you that I hold a great deal of respect for your profession
and the time, care, and dedication you have invested to reach your current
position.

I understand that the work you do is complex and nuanced, and I
appreciate your efforts.

4.

Concern for the Welfare of Others:
* Unlike some individuals involved in this matter, who may not have dedicated
as much time and effort to understanding the impact of their actions, I am
deeply committed to preventing the unnecessary suffering of people and
families.

Those who have not given the same level of care and dedication
should not be the ones setting precedents in such serious matters.

5.

A Plea for Cooperation:
* In light of the above, I urge us to work together to address this situation.

With open and respectful communication, we can ensure that the principles of
justice, fairness, and equality are upheld.

* 7.

Regarding your claims
1.

Firstly,
You stated that the local authority will not communicate with me in any
matter regarding Ms. Ashley Macklin or her son.

This refusal appears to
disregard my request for reasonable adjustments under Section 20 and 21 of
the Equality Act 2010.

The Act requires organizations to make necessary
accommodations to ensure fair and equal communication with individuals with
disabilities, such as Autism.

The case of *Finnigan v Northumbria Police
(2013)* further underscores the duty of public bodies to make reasonable
adjustments in their communication.

2.

Secondly
Your suggestion to ""cease contacting the local authority and other
professional services"" seems to limit my right to freedom of expression.

As
an individual with Autism, I have a legal right to engage with public
bodies and access information, just like any other citizen.

This is
supported by the case of *Chambers v DPP (2012)*, which affirmed the
importance of freedom of expression, even in digital communications.

3.

Thirdly
Your warning against posting correspondence from the local authority on a
public domain raises questions about transparency and public trust?.

Especially in regards to family unlawful family separation, multiple
confessions from the mothers of many different accounts involving many.

different partners.

Whereby the police have apologised and dropped cases
against me due to malicious intent, worry for there being more evidence
respect for the same for our partners.

While I appreciate the need for confidentiality, my request for a read
signature on all emails is a reasonable adjustment section 20,21 to manage
the ambiguity and anxiety associated with my Autism.

This is not an attempt
to breach confidentiality but a necessary step to ensure equal
communication, as mandated by the Equality Act 2010.

In a similar vein, the
*Gurung v Ministry of Defence (2019)* case highlighted the importance of
transparency in communications.

As I am aware its not uncommon for the
rights of those with autism to misplaced and judgements misaligned which
draws back again to equitable fair treatment under legislation and duty of
professional practitioners within the public services sector,
4.

Finally,
Your assertion that I am ""not involved in this matter"" seems to dismiss my
legitimate interest in systemic issues of public interest.

As highlighted
in our 'Nature of Public Interest' document, our organization aims to
address these issues and stimulate impactful change.

My involvement is
guided by these principles, which are supported by the case of *R (on the
application of Guardian News and Media Ltd) v City of Westminster
Magistrates' Court (2012)*, which underscored the importance of public
interest in certain matters.

5.

In conclusion,
I would like to reiterate my commitment to ethical and legal practices,
including respect for individual rights and data protection laws.

I trust
this response provides a clear insight into our operating principles and
reaffirms our commitment to ethical and legal practice.

I hope that we can
continue to communicate in a manner that respects the principles of the
Equality Act 2010, particularly in light of the reasonable adjustments
required for my Autism
6.

Autism Hyper-focus and its Benefits and Risk.

Mine is triggered through being ignored and sends me into a spiral or
analysing and corroborating to find validation, security and
justification.

You will find many Autistics like myself will adopt or have special
interests which can become their only focus, some are on trains, the
function of appliances or reading instructions.

Mine is reading books, and
facts, it's not uncommon.

My forthrightness I remind you is not out of defiance but disability only
made worse by being ignored where I struggle to justify it.

I have missed
my Dads funeral.

His body I was meant to carry and lay to rest but we find
myself here justifying being ignored and now will have ruined my family's
day of placing my father to his last days.

You might clock off at the
weekend but I will live with this for the rest of my life, as will my
family.

7.

Justified in line with the statute and following legal case laws.

8.

Gurung v Ministry of Defence (2019): This case underscores the vital role
of transparency in communications.

It highlights how open dialogue is
essential in building cooperative understanding, especially in complex
situations.

This principle is directly relevant to ensuring that
individuals like Ben Mak can engage effectively with public authorities.

9.

10.

R (on the application of Guardian News and Media Ltd) v City of
Westminster Magistrates' Court (2012): This case accentuates the
significance of public interest in legal and administrative matters.

It
advocates for the involvement of the public and the availability of
accessible information, echoing the concerns raised by Mak in his quest for
clear and open communication.

11.

12.

Ellis v Bolton Council (2007): This landmark decision found that a
failure to constructively engage with an autistic complainant amounted to
disability discrimination under the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA)
1995.

It resonates deeply with the challenges faced by Mak, emphasizing the
need for public bodies to interact more thoughtfully with individuals with
disabilities.

13.

14.

J v DPP (2000): This case declared that unfettered prohibitions on
contacting authorities necessitate qualification respecting fairness
guarantees.

It reflects the concerns of individuals like Mak, who may face
barriers when trying to communicate with public authorities.

15.

16.

Equality Act 2010: This Act mandates reasonable adjustments to ensure
that autistic and disabled individuals can effectively access services and
information, just as others do.

This legislation is crucial in
understanding the adjustments requested by Mak in his communications.

17.

18.

Disability Discrimination Act 1995: As a forerunner in equality laws,
this Act imposes duties on public bodies to make dialogue and processes
inclusive for disabled people.

It sets a precedent that underscores the
rights and needs of individuals like Mak.

19.

20.

I collapsed and blacked out again with the stress and anguish of this
ongoing situation I am being silenced and dismissed on.

Which has been
happening for 2 nearly 3 years, 1 year to the very see and I have official
diagnosis of Autism see both attached doctors note and clinical diagnosis
from Chartered Psychologist.

1.

1.

I look forward to your understanding and cooperation.

Continued justification will happen here: Liverpool City Council Page
Many thanks

Dear Ms. Abigail,
(my teachers included as I won't let this impact my education and they need to
see my conduct and due process and unnecessary obstructions: legitimate interest
criteria is met and essential.

)
I missed my father's funeral because of this.

Devastated- But I am still open to your cooperation without blame.

Addressing Serious Allegations and The Importance of Open Communication
· I received your email but feel there is a misunderstanding, which I hope you
will share a moment for me to redefine and hopefully clear up.

· Firstly, I apologise as it seems you will have gotten an unnecessary stark
particle of the full picture- 'the top end of the letter'.

This coincides with
multiple factors of this entire situation and hope we will bring to a better
resolution.

· The infiltrating particle of the email to any eye - has no portrayal of
pleasantries, which sadly is a false enactment of the full picture I was
offering, and that shares the opposite of its assumed agenda that is less
favoured by us both.

My full message contains my hope to get the situation in
better, more equitable shape, for all most importantly for Abel, second Emily,
and third Ashley.

Ms. Dobson, I hope you can appreciate that there is much at
stake in this set-up whereby Abels needs are ultimately met.

· Not my nephew, but a child all the same.

No-one has lost more through this
than me and Abel, I can assure you.

To which, without doubt, is all uncalled for
everyone involved.

It needs to be put right, smoothly ,without hassle, in the
most effective and less disparaging way, mostly for Abel along with accompanying
parties.

It's important you know, despite any unfounded pre-perceptions of me
that I detest, I am doing my best to keep our partners and Abels family out of
havoc.

Albeit, our previous encounters have not been ideal, but it certainly has
not without its benefits.

1.

The Gravity of the Matter:
The nature of your allegations is very serious, and it is crucial to approach
this matter with the severity it deserves.

I would like to reiterate that my
repeated attempts to communicate are not indicative of obsession, malintent, or
defiance, but rather a manifestation of my Autism-induced hyper-focus.

This
hyper-focus is not a detriment, but a testament to my commitment to caring for
people, seeking justice, and ensuring that policies are correctly implemented.

Contrary to what might be perceived, my actions are driven by a desire to
protect not just my nephew, but also the service providers who, like yourself,
have put a lot of effort, time, and dedication into reaching their current
positions.

These positions are vital and should be protected from being
undermined by individuals who have not invested an equivalent amount of time or
effort into serving the public trust.

This is not to suggest that only those who
have heavily invested in their professional development are deserving of
protection.

Rather, it serves to emphasize the principles of fairness and
natural justice.

Currently, the imbalance in this regard has become
significantly out of scale, disproportionately favoring certain individuals and
completely devoid of prudence.

2.

The Danger of Closed Communication
· My condition is exacerbated by a lack of open communication.

As per the
Equality Act 2010 s 20, s21, public bodies are required to make reasonable
adjustments for individuals with disabilities, including facilitating effective
communication.

By not adhering to these requirements, the authorities pose
inadvertently to be contributing to a potentially dangerous situation for
individuals like myself and a violation of the law.

My reasonable request in the
previous email politely asks for-such, to acquit these damaging impacts, hence
why I missed my fathers funeral, hyper fixated in this response.

I question
following your dismissal of me with allegations not any reflection of my
character, making really hurtful and damaging allegations of fraud, criminal
activity and refusal to talk with me, what attempts to fairly meet this request
have you made? Other than dismiss my attempt for reasonable fair communication?
Whereby I should be carrying the coffin of my fathers.

I am sat here messaging
you, desperate for co-operation holding on to hope that I could protect you,
Emily and the other social workers because that is the right thing to do.

My
father has passed and I am now going to be in the firing line of a lot of hate
for missing it as my fathers youngest son.

I am still open to cooperate, please
don't make this another loss of valuable time, I don't get the chance to see my
father again please don't let this be a double loss- if not for me or Abel.

3.

Respect for Your Profession and Dedication:
· I want to assure you that I hold a great deal of respect for your profession
and the time, care, and dedication you have invested to reach your current
position.

I understand that the work you do is complex and nuanced, and I
appreciate your efforts.

4.

Concern for the Welfare of Others:
· Unlike some individuals involved in this matter, who may not have dedicated
as much time and effort to understanding the impact of their actions, I am
deeply committed to preventing the unnecessary suffering of people and families.

Those who have not given the same level of care and dedication should not be the
ones setting precedents in such serious matters.

5.

A Plea for Cooperation:
· In light of the above, I urge us to work together to address this situation.

With open and respectful communication, we can ensure that the principles of
justice, fairness, and equality are upheld.

Yesterday, I lost my
father, he sadly died on 25th October 2023,as you will already know from my
letters sent, my sister died 21st August 2023 and my Nan December 2022,
3 deaths in 10 months.

This loss has left me in shock and deep sorrow.

I find it necessary to share that I was not by my father's side during his last
moments, which has only intensified my upset.

Regrettably, I've been entangled
in handling unnecessary and unjust consequences of actions that are not my own.

The burden of these circumstances prevented me from being with my father, a
reality that is very difficult to bear and get out of my head and heart.

What further causes discomfort is the knowledge that many people were
informed of my father's deteriorating losses, and ongoing challenges yet those
considered in a position of trust maintained silence.

Continuing to act in
ways that contributed to my current circumstances and uncertainty.

This is a
profoundly serious matter, while I am doing my utmost to remain strong, I am,
like anyone would be, in a very vulnerable state.

I am reaching out to you
today with a sincere request for your cooperation and understanding during
this difficult time for cooperation, less tactful compromise and just honest
open communication.

I am under significant duress, heightened by this passing of my father who now
was denied his right to see me, his youngest son, his last words for me to a
family member were ""if I had fallen out with him"" as he had not heard from
me.

This is due to me being sadly and unnecessarily violently oppressed and
preoccupied with staying safe.

Overwhelmed with all the consequences of being
passed around, ignored and or dismissed.

No-one has contacted me once
regarding being back, having slept in a corridor as stated.

* I still don't feel safe, until I get clear cooperation from Knight Frank.

Wanting and giving, reaching for fairness and equity in knight Franks favour
please can you send to Richard all the time I have been poitely invited into
the Knight Frank's office to chat, and discuss what's going on.

?
* That way, we can see, KF attempted fair proceeds and cooperation before
escalation and unfair ambush.

Showing due process, co-operation and an
attempt to just talk things though has been attempted in good faith,
resolution focused.

* I am more than happy after the funeral to come into the office if the
invitation is there?
I have no reason not to come in or avoid it, I just don't recall ever being
asked hence send it over to Richard and CC me in.

* However, obstructing the entrance to my home by covering up my key hole
and sending me pictures of people outside my flat is not acceptable and a
total violation of my privacy.

I don't consent to it.

Nor appreciate it.

It's not a show of good faith or ethical practice.

I am still left in worry,
uncertainty and limbo.

It's coming up to Christmas, and I'd rather
co-operation happen sooner rather than later, I want Bee and Anton and KF to
cooperate with me, respond to my emails appropriately , and work together with
the help of the shelter to get back up to speed, payments sorted and in order.

It's still impacting my studies, and sense of security.

I would be grateful
for your consideration and respectful understanding- to be treated fairly, and
sensitively, and to allow me to get matters to my full comprehension sorted, I
am still not with my family, frightfully going around in circles with
uncertainty.

Unsure what to do to make this happen quick enough, but rest
assured I still wish to get these issues sorted.Your cooperation is not just
appreciated but necessary as I have not heard back.

During this time as I
navigate through this challenge.

* Although there is still unnecessary uncertainty, one thing is for certain.

my Dad has died, and I wasn't not with him for his last days, and that
could have been prevented.

I look forward to your prompt attention to this matter.

Yours Sincerely,
Mr. B.

LETTER OF BEREAVEMENT
27th October 2023**
Dear Disablity
I hope this reaches you in good time, for discussion and co-operation through the
right channels Mr. R.Jones, from Shelter he has kindly been my designated point
of contact.

Additionally I politely remind you I still retain the right to be
included and involved in my own affairs and handling, so please CC me in as this
has not been happening, and I have not heard anything back from my letters and
concerns I sent.
