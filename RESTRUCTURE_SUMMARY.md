## Before vs After

### Before (Problems)
❌ 15+ HTML files scattered in root  
❌ Mixed evidence and public content  
❌ Python scripts in audio subdirectories  
❌ Temporary files in version control  
❌ No clear assets organization  
❌ Documentation mixed with code  
❌ Confusing for new contributors  
❌ Security risks with evidence in public repo

### After (Benefits)
✅ Clean, organized directory structure  
✅ Clear separation: public vs evidence vs tools  
✅ Content categorized by type (investigations/articles/stories/legal)  
✅ All assets properly organized  
✅ Scripts grouped by function  
✅ Documentation centralized  
✅ Easy to onboard new developers  
✅ Evidence secured via .gitignore  
✅ Follows web development best practices  
✅ Scalable for future growth

## Key Improvements

### 🔒 Security

- Sensitive forensic materials separated from public content
- No temporary files in version control
- Clear boundary between deployed and internal content

### 📁 Organization
- Logical grouping by content type and purpose
- Easy to locate any file within seconds
- Clear naming conventions throughout
- Consistent structure across all directories

### 🚀 Deployment
- `public/` directory contains everything for deployment
- Clean separation makes CI/CD easier
- No confusion about what gets deployed
- Ready for Vercel, Netlify, or any static host

### 👥 Team Collaboration
- New contributors can understand structure immediately
- Clear place for each type of content
- Documentation explains everything
- Follows industry standards

### 📈 Scalability
- Room to grow in each category
- Can add new content types easily
- Asset pipeline ready for optimization
- Future-proof architecture

## Next Steps

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Update Internal Links
The HTML files have been moved to new locations. You'll need to update internal links:

1. **In `public/index.html`** - Update all article links to point to new subdirectories:
   - `investigation-hilton.html` → `investigations/article-hilton-investigation.html`
   - `shubham-story.html` → `stories/shubham-story.html`
   - etc.

2. **In all article pages** - Update navigation links:
   - `../index.html` or adjust based on new depth
   - Asset paths may need updating

3. **Consider using absolute paths from root** for easier maintenance

### Testing Required
- [ ] Test all internal links work correctly
- [ ] Verify all images/SVG files load
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Run link validation tool: `node tools/validation/validate-website-links.js`
- [ ] Test deployment to staging environment

### Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Extract inline CSS to `public/assets/css/` files
- [ ] Create reusable component templates
- [ ] Set up automated link checking in CI/CD
- [ ] Add build script for optimizations
- [ ] Create path helper functions for links
