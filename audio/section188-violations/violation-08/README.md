Section 188 of the Homeless act is if there is reason to believe from one of homeless we provide insulin care housing. Reason not evidence. Not a litany of people all chanting and saying this man's homeless. If there is a reason to believe you all know that I am. There's no. There's nobody attempted robberies. There's no but me fighting for me life. The hunger to be in the meat funeral clothes for two weeks. You all know and not one ears have managed to come together in more than a unit of two and write a statement of proof that you know I am homeless and get this application done. Use all look at who needs to do it and all through the book and expect me to do it while I'm struggling. It ends now.
